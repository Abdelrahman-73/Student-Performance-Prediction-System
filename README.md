# Student-Performance-Prediction-System
The Student Performance Prediction System is a machine learning-powered web app designed to predict students' performance levels (Low, Medium, High) based on their test scores and demographic factors.

# Key Features:

Performance Prediction: Uses advanced machine learning models to analyze Math, Reading, and Writing scores along with demographic data.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly web app built with Flask for instant predictions.
Data Visualization: Insights via graphs (Seaborn & Matplotlib) showing trends by gender, parental education, and race/ethnicity.
Automated Model Selection: Evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate predictions.

# Technologies: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Pickle.
